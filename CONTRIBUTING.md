## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/innofake/omni-components/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submitting Issues

Issues are intended for:

* [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)
* [Logging Feature Requests](#logging-feature-requests)

Basic Guidelines:
* **Do** search for a similar / existing Issue prior to logging a new one.
* **Don't** use issues for any personal support. Use [Discussions](https://github.com/innofake/omni-components/discussions) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) instead.
* **Don't** side-track or derail issues threads. Stick to the topic please.
* **Don't** post comments using just "+1", "++" or "üëç". Use reactions instead.

### Reporting Bugs

A bug is an error, flaw or fault associated with any part of the project.

Basic Guidelines:
* **Do** search for a similar / existing Issue prior to logging a new one.
* **Do** describe the bug concisely. Avoid adding extraneous code, logs or screenshots.
* **Do** add a minimal test or repro (e.g. [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), etc.) to demonstrate the bug.

### Logging Feature Requests

A feature request is an improvement or new capability associated with any part of the project.

Basic Guidelines:
* **Do** search for a similar / existing Issue prior to logging a new one.
* **Do** provide sufficient motivation / use case(s) for the feature.
* **Do not** submit multiple requests within one request.

## Development

### Branches

* `main` - Used for stable releases, which we do once a month.
* `develop` - Default branch of the repo for all Pull Requests.

### Getting Started

#### Dependencies

* Git (v2+)
* Node.js (v16+)
* NPM (v7+)
* VS Code + Recommended Extensions (recommended, but not required).

#### Setup

1. [Fork](https://github.com/innofake/omni-components) the repository and create a branch from `develop`.
2. Run `npm ci` inside the repository root.
3. Start up the development project with `npm run storybook` (or by pressing F5 in VS Code).

## Standards & Practices
### Naming Conventions

1. Folder names MUST be created using all lower case Kebab Case, e.g. `real-time`.
2. File names for classes MUST be created using Pascal Case, e.g. `MyComponent`.
3. Module names MUST match that of the file name, e.g. `MyComponent.ts` contains `export class MyComponent { ... }`.
4. Properties MUST be created using Camel Case, e.g. `@property({...}) innerPosition: string;`.
4. Properties MUST NOT contain any verbs, e.g. `@property({...}) label: string;`.
