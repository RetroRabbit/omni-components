## Development

### Branches

* `main` - Used for stable releases, which we do once a month.
* `develop` - Default branch of the repo for all Pull Requests.

### Getting Started

#### Dependencies

* Git (v2+)
* Node.js (v16+)
* NPM (v7+)
* VS Code + Recommended Extensions (recommended, but not required).

#### Setup

1. [Fork](https://github.com/innofake/omni-components) the repository and create a branch from `develop`.
2. Clone the forked repo and run `npm ci` inside the repository root.
3. Start up the dev server with `npm run storybook` (or by launching debugging in VS Code).

### Storybook

This project makes extensive use of [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for the purpose of developing, testing as well as exploring published component documentation.

### Directory Structure

When working with our components, please note the following key parts of the directory structure:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ button
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Button.stories.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Button.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ themes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

* `src` - Contains all UI components, organized into a flat list of folders for each component, e.g. `button`:
  * `Button.stories.ts` - The [Story](https://storybook.js.org/docs/web-components/get-started/whats-a-story) file for the component.
  * `Button.ts` - The component. *(NOTE: There might be more than one related component, depending on complexity and composition)*
  * `index.ts` - The directory-level index, containing one or more component exports.
* `stories` - Storybook application related helpers and components.
* `themes` - Built-in basic themes, viewable within the Storybook application.
### Naming Conventions

1. Folder names MUST be created using all lower case Kebab Case, e.g. `my-component`.
2. File names for classes MUST be created using Pascal Case, e.g. `MyComponent`.
3. Module names MUST match that of the file name, e.g. `MyComponent.ts` contains `export class MyComponent { ... }`.
4. Properties MUST be created using Camel Case, e.g. `@property({...}) innerPosition: string;`.
4. Properties MUST NOT contain any verbs, e.g. `@property({...}) label: string;`.
