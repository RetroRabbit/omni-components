        <h1>Theme Support</h1>

        <h3>All Omni Components support our theme CSS variables</h3>
        <p>
        Theme variables are used to style the overall theme of all Omni Components. 
        Each component also can still be styled individually using their own component specific CSS variables, which would override the theme if specified.
        </p>
       
        <p>
        Theme variables typically affect:
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◉ Shared colors</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◉ Fonts</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◉ Borders</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;◉ Accessibility options</p>
        </p>
       
        <p>There are built-in themes available to test how theme variables can affect te various components. Use the theme dropdown to select a built-in theme or select "Light Theme" to view the components in their default state. The source for the built-in themes are available <a target="_self" href="theme-support/#examples" >below</a>.</p>
       
        <p>Alternatively, a custom theme can be authored or uploaded to have a live view of its effects on the components.</p>
        <p>Try it now by selecting your current theme to be "Custom Theme"!</p>
